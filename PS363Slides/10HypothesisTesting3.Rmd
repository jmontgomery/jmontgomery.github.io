# Lecture 10: Hypothesis Testing 3

## Roadmap

Last class:

- Hypothesis tests with small samples
- Types of errors
- Discussion of one-sided/two-sided tests

\pause
This class:

- Relationship between CI and NHPT
- Working more examples

## Visualizing confidence intervals and null-hypothesis testing}

### Example: Confidence interval approach \#1

According to a union agreement, the mean income for all senior-level
assembly-line workers in a large company equals \$525 per week.  A
representative of a women's group decides to analyze whether the mean
income $\mu$ for female employees matches this norm.  For a random
sample of 36 female employees, $\bar{y} = \$495$ and $s=\$75$.

\pause

- Let's use a 95\% CI, or $\alpha = .05$, and assume that the CLT applies  (no T-distribution) \pause
- $525 \pm 1.96 \sigma_{\bar{y}} = 525 \pm 1.96 \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}$  \pause
- $= 525 \pm 1.96 \frac{75}{\sqrt{36}}$ \pause
- $525 \pm 1.96 \times 24.5$ \pause
- 95\% CI  = $[500.5, 549.5]$

\pause 
Since we observed $\bar{y} = 495$, we can reject the null hypothesis.

## Example: Confidence interval approach \#2

According to a union agreement, the mean income for all senior-level
assembly-line workers in a large company equals \$525 per week.  A
representative of a women's group decides to analyze whether the mean
income $\mu$ for female employees matches this norm.  For a random
sample of 36 female employees, $\bar{y} = \$495$ and $s=\$75$.


\pause

- Let's use a 95\% CI, or $\alpha = .05$\pause
- $495 \pm 1.96 \sigma_{\bar{y}} = 495 \pm 1.96 \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}$  \pause
- $= 495 \pm 1.96 \frac{75}{\sqrt{36}}$ \pause
- $495 \pm 1.96 \times 24.5$ \pause
 95\% CI  = $[470.5, 519.5]$ \pause

\pause 
Since $H_0: \mu = 525$ is not in that interval, we can reject the null hypothesis.

## Research projects

First, think of a research question!

- What topics interest you?
- What phenomenon do you want to explain?
- If you don't care about the question itself, then the project will be miserable to complete.
