## Beyond artificial math problems


-  So far we have calculated hypothesis tests where the null
  hypothesis is specified in advance.  \pause
- However, in most cases we cannot specify a ``base case'' in
  advance.  \pause What we really want to be able to do is make
  relative comparisons.  
    -  Do women get paid less than men?
    - Do ideological extremists vote at higher rates than moderates?
    - This also allows us to estimate ATE \pause
- Today we will learn how to compare two **independent samples** to estimate the ATE.
    - Large samples
    - Small samples (pooled variance)




-----




We have two \textit{independent samples}, and we want to compare
them.  \pause Our data will look like this.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
Variable 1 & Variable 2 \\
(Outcome or response) & (Explanatory or grouping)  \\
\hline
2.1 & 1 \\
2.4 & 0 \\
3.0 & 0 \\
1.79 & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



-----


Let's imagine that we have two large samples of men $(n_1 \ge 20)$ and
women $(n_2 \ge 20)$.  \pause For each sample, we have a sample mean and
a sample standard deviation.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
& Sample 1 & Sample 2 \\
Means & $\bar{y}_1$  &  $\bar{y}_2$\\
Standard Dev. & $S_1$  &  $S_2$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\pause

What we want to do (first) is to construct a confidence interval for
$\mu_2 - \mu_1$.  We want to estimate this \textit{difference}.

----

### Confidence interval for difference in means

Estimate $\pm$ Test statistic $\times$ Standard Error

\pause
Here, the CI is: $(\bar{y_2} - \bar{y_1}) \pause \pm Z \times \hat{\sigma}_{\bar{y_2}  - \bar{y_1}}$

\pause

The standard error is:
$$\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{y_2}
  - \bar{y_1}} = \displaystyle \sqrt{\frac{S_1^2}{n_1}+ \frac{S_2^2}{n_2}}$$
\pause

$$\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{y_2}
  - \bar{y_1}} = \displaystyle \sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2_{\bar{y_1}}+\hat{\sigma}^2_{\bar{y_2}}}$$


----




### Hypothesis testing about differences

We can also do hypothesis testing about differences.

$$H_0: \mu_2 = \mu_1 \pause \Rightarrow H_0: \mu_2 - \mu_1 = 0$$ \pause
$$H_a: \mu_2 \ne \mu_1 \pause \Rightarrow H_a: \mu_2 - \mu_1 \ne 0$$

\pause

$Z = \displaystyle \frac{\mbox{Estimate - Null}}{\mbox{Standard Error}} \pause =
\frac{(\bar{y_2} - \bar{y_1}) - 0}{\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{y_2}
  - \bar{y_1}} }$


\pause
Just as before, we use this test statistic to calculate a p-value.

### We are less extreme than (many of us) think we are

#### What is the effect of knowing that people are not as extreme as we think they are?

\textbf{Research question}: Does learning that the public is less polarized than we think affect voters' own level of extremity?

\pause

\textbf{Experimental design}:

- \textit{Ask}: Individuals are asked to estimate the political views of conservative and liberal voters and then  asked about their own political views.
- \textit{Tell}: Individuals are told the political views of conservative and liberal voters and then asked about their own political views.
- \textit{Distort}: Individuals are told that the political views of conservative and liberal voters are \textit{more} polarized than they are and then asked about their own political views.

#### Results

----

#### Example: Polarization Misperception

In a survey experiment run using online respondents, is there a
significant difference in political extremity (taking values between 0
and 1) for those in the \textit{ask} and
\textit{tell} treatment conditions? \pause $(H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2)$?

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l c c }
&  $\bar{y}$ & SE \\
Ask &  0.515 & (0.048) \\
Tell &  0.435 & (0.047) \\
Distort & 0.547 & (0.048)
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\pause


----

Let's look at Ask vs. Tell:
$$\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{y_2}
  - \bar{y_1}} = \pause \displaystyle \sqrt{0.048^2 + 0.047^2}
= 0.067$$ \pause $$z = \displaystyle \frac{(\bar{y_2} - \bar{y_1}) - 0}{\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{y_2}
  - \bar{y_1}} } = \pause \frac{0.515-0.435}{0.067} = \pause 1.194 $$
  

Interpret this? 

\texttt{2 * pnorm(1.194, lower.tail=FALSE)}=0.232


\pause
95\% CI: $0.08 \pm 1.96 \times ?\Rightarrow (?, ?)$ \pause
Interpret this?


----

## Now with small samples


A common assumption we make for small samples is to assume that
$\sigma_1 = \sigma_2$. \pause This allows for exact calculations (although
\texttt{R} can do the calculations when this assumption is not met).
The alternative, where $\sigma_1 \ne \sigma_2$ is commonly called
``robust.''


\pause 
We are going to do the exact same thing as we did before except that:

-  We are going to use the t-distribution instead of the normal
  (recalling that we have to use degrees of freedom).
- We are going to use a slightly different calculation for
  standard errors.

----


### Comparing groups with small samples

We will calculate the standard error as:

$$\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{y_2} - \bar{y_1}} = \displaystyle \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{n_1}
+ \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{n_2}} = \hat{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}$$

where $\hat{\sigma}^2$ is the \textbf{pooled variance} calculate as: 

$$\hat{\sigma} = \displaystyle \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1)S_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)S_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}$$

\pause And to calculate a confidence interval, we will calculate:

$$(\bar{y_2} - \bar{y_1}) \pm t_{df} \times \hat{\sigma}_{\bar{y_2} -
  \bar{y_1}}$$
where d.f. $= (n_1 -1) +(n_2 -1) \pause = n_1 + n_2 -2$

#### Example: Height of men and women WashU


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|lll}
& Women & Men \\
\hline
Mean & 64.77 & 69.62 \\
S & 3.84 & 3.19 \\
n & 24 & 29 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\pause

- $\bar{y_2} - \bar{y_1} = 69.62 - 64.77 = 4.85$ \pause
- $\hat{\sigma} = \sqrt{\frac{(24-1)3.84^2 + (29-1)3.19^2}{24+29-2}} = 3.50$  \pause
- $\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{y_2} - \bar{y_1}} =  \hat{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}=3.50 \sqrt{\frac{1}{24} + \frac{1}{29}} =0.966$  \pause
- $d.f. = 24+29-2 = 51$ \pause
- $t_{51, .025} =$ \texttt{qt(.025, df = 51, lower.tail = FALSE)} $= 2.01$ 

\pause

95\% CI: $4.85 \pm \big(2.01 \times 0.966) = (2.91, 6.79)$ \pause Interpret? 

Hypothesis test: $t=  \frac{4.85 - 0}{0.966} \approx 5.02$  \pause  $\mathtt{2*pt(5.02, df=51, lower.tail=F)} \approx 0$
