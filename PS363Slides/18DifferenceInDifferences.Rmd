# Causality in Regression and Difference in Differences

## Road map

Where we have been:

- What is regression?
- How to interpret coefficients?
- Interactions/Dummies

\pause
Today:

- Using regression for causal inference
- Using difference-in-differences to make causal claims


----

## Causal inference



- We will use T to represent a treatment variable.
- For a categorical treatment 

\begin{center}
  $T_i =   \begin{array}{l}
  \mbox{1 if unit i receives the treatment}\\
  \mbox{0 if unit i receives the control}
  \end{array}$
\end{center}

\pause 

- We let $y_i^1$ represent the outcome of the ith unit if the
  treatment is given. \pause
- We let $y_i^0$ represent the outcome of the ith unit if the
  control is given. \pause
- One of these is observed, the other is the counterfactual --
  what would have been observed if the other treatment have been given? \pause
- The causal effect of $T_i$ on observation $i$ will then be $y_i^1 - y_i^0$

\pause

-  $ATE = mean(y_i^1) -mean(y_i^0)$
-  $ATE =(\alpha+\beta) -(\alpha)$
-  $ATE = \beta$

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{./LectureGraphics/ATE2}
\end{center}

- $Y=\alpha + T_1\beta_1 + T_2 \beta_2$

\pause

- Control: $Y=\alpha$
- Treatment 1: $Y=\alpha + \beta_1$
- Treatment 2: $Y=\alpha + \beta_2$


----

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{./LectureGraphics/ATE2}
\end{center}

- $Y=\alpha + T_1\beta_1 + T_2 \beta_2$


- $ATE_1 = mean(y_i^1) -mean(y_i^0)$
- $ATE_1 =(\alpha+\beta_1) -(\alpha)$
- $ATE_1 = \beta_1$


----

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{./LectureGraphics/ATE2}
\end{center}

- $ATE_2 = mean(y_i^2) -mean(y_i^0)$
- $ATE_2 =(\alpha+\beta_2) -(\alpha)$
- $ATE_2 = \beta_2$

#### Is blue Different than green?


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{./LectureGraphics/ATE2}
\end{center}


- $ATE_{2 vs. 1} = mean(y_i^2) -mean(y_i^1)$
- $ATE_{2 vs. 1} =(\alpha+\beta_2) -(\alpha+\beta1)$
- $ATE_{2 vs. 1} = \beta_2-\beta_1$

#### Is blue Different than green?


A much easier way to do this, is to change what is the ``control'' and
leave that out.

### Control variables


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{./LectureGraphics/ATE4}
\end{center}

$$Y=\alpha+T\beta_1 + X \beta_2$$

----



### Control variables


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{./LectureGraphics/ATE5}
\end{center}

$$Y=\alpha+T\beta_1 + X \beta_2$$

### Adding control variables improves precision

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l c c}
\hline
& No Control & Control \\
Intercept &2.67 &1.89 \\
& (0.22) & (0.24) \\
 Treatment &1.43 &1.42\\
 &(0.31) & (0.29)\\
 Covariate & & 1.78 \\
 && (0.29)\\
 \hline
 $R^2$& 0.056& 0.136\\
 \hline
\end{tabular}

## Difference in differences




\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{./LectureGraphics/ATE6}
\end{center}



$$Y=\alpha+Treatment\beta_1 + Pre/Post \beta_2 + (T \times PP) \beta_3$$

###  Difference in differences

- Assume parallel paths
- The treatment group would have moved in parallel to the control
  group in the absence of the intervention.
- We can estimate the effect of the treatment on the treated 

----


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{./LectureGraphics/ATE8}
\end{center}


- We need to model both what happened and what would have happened
- $Y=\alpha+Treatment\beta_1 + Pre/Post \beta_2 + (T \times PP) \beta_3$

### Diff-in-diff model

\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
  \hline
 & Estimate & Std. Error & t value & Pr($>$$|$t$|$) \\ 
  \hline
(Intercept) & 1.0591 & 0.1547 & 6.84 & 0.0000 \\ 
  Assignment & -4.0522 & 0.2188 & -18.52 & 0.0000 \\ 
  PrePost & 3.8202 & 0.2188 & 17.46 & 0.0000 \\ 
  Assignment:PrePost & 4.2994 & 0.3095 & 13.89 & 0.0000 \\

Let's write down the prediction equation on the board.

#### Difference in differences

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{./LectureGraphics/ATE9}
\end{center}

\pause
\vspace{-.2in}

The difference between what we observed
($\alpha+\beta_1+\beta_2+\beta_3$) and what we would have observed
($\alpha+\beta_1+\beta_2$) is $$(\alpha+\beta_1+\beta_2+\beta_3)-(\alpha+\beta_1+\beta_2) = \beta_3$$.

### Difference in difference: Discussion

- Despite being tricky to think about it, it is simple to estimate. \pause
- Does \textit{not require} that the treatment and control group be similar, only that that they would have had parallel paths. \pause
- You can (and should) also control for other factors, which will help improve your estimates.

### Applied Example: Minimum wage laws

What is the effect of increasing the minimum wage on low-wage workers?

- Side 1?
- Side 2?


----


Study basics:

- In 1992, New Jersey increased the minimum wage from \$4.25/hour to \$5.05/hour.
- Researchers collected information about the number of full time employees (as a proportion of total number of employees) at various fast food chains before and after the reform.

\pause

- Researchers \textit{also} collected the same information from the same chains in Pennsylvania to serve as a counterfactual.
- Are New Jersey and Pennsylvania perfect counterfactuals for each other?

- Divide up into your groups.
- Interpret this plot.  What was the effect of the wage increase
  in New Jersey?  Be ready to answer.
