## Small sample significance testing for quantitative variables


### Step 1: Assumptions
- Random sampling
- Quantitative data \pause
- **Population is distributed normally**

### Step 2: State hypotheses
- $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ (e.g., $\mu = 12$)
- $H_a: \mu \ne \mu_0$
- This is a "two-sided test," but it may be a "one-sided."

----



### Step 3: Calculate a test statistic
-  $\displaystyle t^\ast = \frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{\sigma_{\bar{Y}}}, df = (n-1)$ 
- Just as before, this comes from the sampling distribution of $\bar{Y}$

\pause

### Step 4: P-Value
- $p = Pr\Big(|t| \ge |\frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{\sigma_{\bar{Y}}}|\Big)
  = 2 \times Pr(t \ge |\frac{\bar{Y} - \mu_0}{\sigma_{\bar{Y}}}|)$ \pause
- Make sure you are using the right degrees of freedom. \pause  
- We use both tails, because we want to find the probability of
  error in both directions.
- \texttt{2*pt(abs($t^\ast$), df = n-1, lower.tail=F)}

----



### Step 5: Draw a conclusion

- If $p \le \alpha$ we conclude that the evidence supports $H_a$
- But always report the p-value


----

### Example: State spending on education

Assume that the theory is that states are spending less than 5\% of their income on education.  The data indicate that:

- $\bar{Y} = 4.7$, $S =0 .0922$
- $t^\ast = \frac{4.7 - 5}{0.09/\sqrt{50}}=-2.279$, $df = 49$
- P-value=\texttt{2*pt(2.279, df=49, lower.tail = F)} = 0.027

### Type 1 and Type II Error


\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{|ll|cc|}
\hline
 & & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textit{Jury decision}} \\
& & Guilty & Innocent \\
\hline
 \textit{Truth}& Guilty & Correct & Type II \\
 & Innocent & Type 1 & Correct \\
\hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}


----

###

Imagine we put the null hypothesis on trial:
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{|ll|cc|}
\hline
 & & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textit{Researcher Conclusion}} \\
& & Reject Null & Don't reject \\
\hline
 \textit{Truth} & Null is False & Correct & Type II \\
 & Null is True & Type 1 & Correct \\
\hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}


\pause

- Type I error is when we reject a null hypothesis when the null it is actually true.  \pause
- Type II error is when we fail to reject a null hypothesis when the null is actually false. \pause
- We tend to prioritize reducing Type I error, although there are tradeoffs.

----



### Notes on Type I and Type II error

How to calculate each?

- Type I:
    - $Pr( Reject~H_0 | H_0 True) \pause =  \alpha$
    - This is our primary focus

\pause

- Type II (hard):
    - $Pr(Fail~ to~ reject | H_0~ False)$
    - $H_0$ can be false for false for many values \pause
    - "Power" of a test is $1 - Pr(Type~II~error)$ \pause
    - Leave this for a more advance classes
    - There is a trade-off between Type I and Type II error

-----


### Reprise: Large sample significance testing for proportions

#### Step 1: Assumptions

- Random sampling
- Qualitative data  
- $n\ge \displaystyle \frac{10}{min(\pi_0, 1 - \pi_0)}$
- $min()$ means the minimum of the two numbers
- If our $n$ is bigger than this, we can use the calculations below.
- The 10 is sort of arbitrary (it is a good rule of thumb).


----

#### Step 2: State hypotheses
- $H_0: \pi = \pi_0$ (e.g., $\pi_0 = 0.5$)
- $H_a: \pi \ne \pi_0$ 
- This is a "two-sided test," but it may be a "one-sided."


----


#### Step 3: Calculate a test statistic
- $\displaystyle Z^\ast = \frac{\hat{\pi} - \pi_0}{\sigma_{\pi_0}}$, \pause
   $\sigma_{\pi_0} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi_0(1-\pi_0)}{n}}$
- Just as before, this comes from the sampling distribution
   $\hat{\pi}$ that would exist if $H_0$ were true.
- Note we are assuming that $\pi=\pi_0$ to calculate the SE.


----

#### Step 4: P-Value

- $p = Pr(Z \ge |\frac{\hat{\pi} - \pi_0}{\sigma_{\pi_0}}|) + Pr(Z
   \le -|\frac{\hat{\pi} - \pi_0}{\sigma_{\pi_0}}|) = Pr(|Z| \ge
   |\frac{\hat{\pi} - \pi_0}{\sigma_{\pi_0}}|)$
- $= 2 \times Pr(Z \ge   |\frac{\hat{\pi} - \pi_0}{\sigma_{\pi_0}}|)$
- We use both tails.


####  Step 5: Draw a conclusion

- If $p \le \alpha$ we conclude that the evidence supports $H_a$
- You should **still** report the p-value.

### Example: Women in Congress

Women are (roughly) 50\% of the U.S. population.  Are they represented
(descriptively) in Congress?  Using data from the 107th House we see that there are 60 women in Congress. \pause

- $H_0: \pi = 0.5$, $H_a: \pi \ne 0.5$
- $n=435, \hat{\pi} = \frac{60}{435}$ \pause
- Are assumptions met? \pause
- $\displaystyle n \ge \frac{10}{min(.5, 1-.5)} = 20$ \pause
- Since our $n$ is bigger, we can proceed

- $Z =  \frac{\hat{\pi}  - 0.5}{\sigma_{\pi_0}} =
  \frac{0.1379 - 0.5}{\sqrt{\frac{.5(1-.5)}{435}}} =
  \frac{-0.3621}{0.02397} = -15.11$ \pause
- \texttt{2*pnorm(15.11, lower.tail=F) } $\approx 0.0001 \Rightarrow$ reject null. \pause
- Notice that I used positive 15.11 and not -15.11.  I used the absolute value.

### Critical values 


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{./LectureGraphics/one-sided}
\end{center}


- You can think of hypothesis testing as, <br> "Is the t-statistic so extreme that it is in the rejection region?" \pause
- If $|Z^\ast|$ is bigger than some "critical value," $Z_\alpha$, then  p-value will be smaller than $\alpha$. \pause
- Note that the p-value calculations will be different if you are only calculating the area under one-tail. \pause
- When you calculate the p-value for one-sided tests, you need to make sure you are calculating it for the correct tail.




----

### One sided vs. two sided


**Central message \#1**: If you are doing a one-sided test *and the
estimator IS NOT in the region of the null hypothesis*, don't multiply
by 2 when calculating the p-value.

- Go back to our example of women in the U.S. House. 
- If $H_0: \pi > 0.5, H_a: \pi < 0.5$ 
- The test statistic IS in the region covered by the alternative
  hypothesis and IS NOT in the region covered by the null. \pause
- This might still be written as $H_0: \pi = 0$, but it should
  still be $H_a: \pi < 0.5$.
- $Z =  \frac{\hat{\pi}  - 0.5}{\sigma_{\pi_0}}=
  \frac{0.1379 - 0.5}{\sqrt{\frac{.5(1-.5)}{435}}} =
  \frac{-0.3621}{0.02397} = -15.11$ \pause
- Note that we are still using $\pi_0 = 0.5$.  This is the smallest
  value possible for $\pi$ in the region covered by the null
  hypothesis. \pause
- We use $P(Z > \displaystyle |\frac{\hat{\pi}  - 0.5}{\sigma_{\pi_0}}|)$
  $\ldots$ no absolute value signs around the Z.
- \texttt{pnorm(15.11, lower.tail=F) } $\approx 0.00005 \Rightarrow$ reject null.

### One sided vs. two sided

**Central message \#2**: If you are doing a one-sided test
\textit{and the estimator IS in the region of the null hypothesis},
don't multiply by 2 when calculating the p-value \textbf{and} choose
the tail so that you get an answer larger than 0.5.


- Go back to our example of women in the U.S. House.
- If $H_0: \pi <0.5, H_a: \pi > 0.5$ \pause
- The test statistics IS NOT in the region covered by the
  alternative hypothesis. \pause
- This might still be written as $H_0: \pi = 0$, but it should
  still be $H_a: \pi > 0.5$. \pause
- $Z =  \frac{\hat{\pi}  - 0.5}{\sigma_{\pi_0}}=
  \frac{0.1379 - 0.5}{\sqrt{\frac{.5(1-.5)}{435}}} =
  \frac{-0.3621}{0.02397} = -15.11$ \pause
- We want $P(Z \le \displaystyle |\frac{\hat{\pi}  - 0.5}{\sigma_{\pi_0}}|)$ \pause
- \texttt{pnorm(15.11, lower.tail=T) } $\approx 0.99995
  \Rightarrow$ do not reject the null. 
- Notice that \texttt{lower.tail = T}
