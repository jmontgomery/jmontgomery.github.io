<h2><span class="header-section-number">28.2</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve talked about univariate inference. This is useful, say, if we wanted to conduct a poll to determine what proportion of the country intends to vote Republican in the next election, or to determine the average household income in a certain country. But there is one crucial part of social science that this class has not really addressed: how to determine cause and effect.</p>
<p>Causation is a crucial part of the social sciences (and of science in general). Political scientists aren’t just concerned with <em>describing</em> a certain factor in the world (income, political view); they’re concerned with understanding how those factors relate to each other. Does income inequality cause political polarization? Does being democratic make a country less likely to go to war with its neighbors? Does being appointed by a Republican make a judge more likely to vote consistent with conservative policies?</p>
</div>
<div id="so-what-exactly-is-causation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">28.3</span> So, what exactly is causation?</h2>
<p>Imagine you’re driving a car down a four-lane road. All of the sudden, out of nowhere, a car drives out of its lane, into yours, right in front of your car. You can tell that the driver is texting, and isn’t looking at the road. You slam on the breaks, and your hood collides with his fender. Fortunately, you’re shaken, but fine, and so is the other driver. Chances are, you will be asking yourselves some questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did that happen?<br />
</li>
<li>What would have happened if I had been paying more attention to the cars around you?</li>
<li>What if that driver hadn’t been texting?<br />
You would be asking yourself what caused that accident.</li>
</ul>
<p>What does it mean for something to have <strong>caused</strong> that accident? What things can we point to? Well, we’d probably say that the other driver caused the accident. Or maybe, if we wanted to be precise, we’d say that the fact that the driver was texting while driving caused the accident. But what does it mean when we say that the fact that the driver was texting <strong>caused</strong> the accident? And what makes the fact that the driver was texting while driving any different than the fact that the sky was blue before the accident? After all, both are true statements. But only one could reasonably be considered a “cause” of the accident.</p>
<p>Philosophers and scientists have pondered the question of cause and effect for centuries, and have come up with various different definitions of causation. But the definition that is generally used by political scientists is this: <strong>a X causes Y if Y would not have occurred but for X.</strong></p>
<p>One of the most famous examples of this in popular culture occurs in the movie “It’s A Wonderful Life.” In the movie, the protagonist, George Bailey, in a moment of despair, wishes that he had never existed. Following this, his guardian angel shows him what his community would look like if he had never existed. As George Bailey walks around this new version of the world, he directly sees what he has caused, because the world he sees is a world in which everything is the same <em>except for one thing</em>: he was never born. Because of this, every difference between the actual world and this hypothetical world can be attributed to his birth and life. In science, the term for what would be if it were not for the existence of some causal factor-is called the <strong>counterfactual. </strong></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TNQ76UyurLA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In this movie we see two worlds. The first, is what actually happened. George saved his brother from drowning when they were kids. He got married and had kids. He runs a small Building &amp; Loan company that staves off the worst of the great depression in his town.</p>
<p>The world his angel shows him is the <strong>counterfactual</strong>. It is the the world <em>as it would have existed</em> without George Baily. His little brother drowned. His girl never go married and his kids were never born. The Building &amp; Loan shut down and his hometown became a slum.</p>
<p>One world is what happened with George Baily (<span class="math inline">\(Y=State~of~world|X=GB~Born\)</span>). The other is the world that would have happened without George Baily (<span class="math inline">\(Y=State~of~world | X=GB~not~born\)</span>) but where everything else was exactly the same. Anything that was different between these two worlds was, under our definition, <strong>caused</strong> by George Baily.</p>
<p>Turning to a more political example, if we wanted to know whether the stimulus package of 2008 created jobs, then the counterfactual would be what <em>would</em> have happened <strong>if</strong> the stimulus package had not been passed. So to estimate the effect of the stimulus, we have to know what would have happened without it. If that counterfactual is that unemployment would have increased to 20% in the absence of stimulus, then we could conclude that the stimulus package was effective in creating jobs. If the counterfactual was that unemployment would have gone down to 2% in the absence of stimulus, then we could conclude that the stimulus package failed. So your estimate of the effect of the stimulus depends entirely on what you assume would have happened in the absence of stimulus.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-do-we-determine-what-the-counterfactual-is" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">28.4</span> How do we determine what the counterfactual is?</h2>
<p>As you may have figured out, it’s actually impossible for us to know what the counterfactual is, because, logically, X cannot simultaneously be true and not true. Either the incumbent wins an election, or she doesn’t. Either a household experiences tax increases, or it doesn’t. Either the stimulus is put into effect, or it isn’t. Either the other driver was texting or he/she wasn’t. We do not have the luxury of being able to see the results of both scenarios play out simultaneously.</p>
<p>This is sometimes called the <strong>fundamental problem of causal inference</strong>. We can observe only the world in front of us. We cannot observe hypothetical counterfactuals</p>
<p>But do not lose hope. There are several ways scientists have developed to estimate causal effects that can partially overcome this problem. The method that most directly determines cause is an experiment.</p>
<div id="how-does-an-experiment-work" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">28.4.1</span> How does an experiment work?</h3>
<p>Very basically, in an experiment, we isolate the one variable whose effect we want to measure. We create two groups, which are (ideally) identical in every single way, except one group is exposed to that variable (called the treatment group), while the other is not (called the control group).</p>
<p>In order to get the two groups to be as similar as possible, we use randomization. That is, we randomly assign people to be either in the control or treatment groups.</p>
<p>For example, if we wanted to study the impact of a certain medication on heart pressure, then we would randomly assign the participants to either receive the medication or receive a placebo. If the treatment group improved, and the control group didn’t, we would be more confident that the cause of this improvement was the medication.</p>
</div>
<div id="so-how-do-we-measure-the-effect-of-the-treatment-in-an-experiment" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">28.4.2</span> So, how do we measure the effect of the treatment in an experiment?</h3>
<p>Imagine you’re running an experiment on political views. Let’s say you want to know whether exposure to negative campaign ads makes someone less likely to believe that politicians care about them. You randomly assign half of your subjects to watch a negative campaign ad, and half of your subjects watch the same clip, altered slightly to change the tone from negative to neutral. You then ask the subjects to fill out a survey, evaluating their attitudes towards politics.</p>
<p>If your experiment works the way any other experiment does, there’s probably a lot of statistical noise. Even if your experiment worked, it’s unlikely that every single person in the treatment group scored lower than every single person in the control group. There’s probably a decent amount of variance in both groups. So how do we measure the effect of the experimental treatment?</p>
<p>It’s actually somewhat straightforward: we measure the difference between the <strong>average</strong> score for the treatment group, and the <strong>average</strong> score for the control group. This will give us something we call the <strong>average treatment effect (ATE)</strong>. To state it more formally, the formula for the ATE is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)) \]</span></p>
<p>Where N is the number of subjects,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Y_i(1)\)</span> is the outcome if the observation is in the treatment group, and <span class="math inline">\(Y_i(0)\)</span> is the outcome variable in the control group.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine that individuals 1,2,3 are assigned to the treatment group, and individuals 4 and 5 are assigned to the control group.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ATE=\frac{Y_1+Y_2+Y_3-Y_4-Y_5}{5}\]</span></p>
<p>(NOTE: We haven’t yet covered regression, but when we do, something to keep in mind: the beta coefficient in a regression is that ATE for that variable.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="but-what-if-we-cant-do-an-experiment" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">28.5</span> But what if we can’t do an experiment?</h2>
<p>Especially in the social sciences, we cannot experimentally manipulate everything. We cannot randomly have certain countries go to war with each other, and others not, to see what the impact is. We cannot force certain counties to elect Democrats, and others to elect Republicans. In those cases, we cannot use experimental methods to evaluate causal claims. So instead, we use some statistical methods to try to untangle causation.</p>
<p>When we can’t use experimental control, then we collect data, and try to determine cause using statistical control. When we are trying to figure out whether X caused Y, there are 3 things we want to do:</p>
<p><em>1) Establish temporal order</em></p>
<p>For X to have caused Y, X must have come before Y. This is relatively straightforward. BUT, just because X came before Y, doesn’t mean that X caused Y.</p>
<p><em>2) Show an association</em></p>
<p>This is what we will focus on the rest of the semester, using regression and a number of other statistical techniques. Basically, you have to show that there is some sort of relationship between two variables. BUT, just because X is associated with Y, doesn’t mean X caused Y. Correlation is not causation. For example, ice cream sales are closely related to drowning deaths (i.e., when ice cream sales rise, so do drowning deaths). Of course, that doesn’t mean that ice cream sales cause drowning deaths; both just happen to occur in the summer.</p>
<p><em>3) Eliminate alternative explanations</em></p>
<p>We want to show that no other factor explains the outcome that we are trying to explain.</p>
<p>Once we have done these three things, then we can say that X caused Y. But doing this is <strong>not</strong> easy. In particular, eliminating alternative explanations is very difficult because of something we call <strong>confounding</strong>.</p>
<p>This brings up an important concept known as <strong>endogeneity</strong>. That basically just refers to when one variable in a model is correlated with another, like how the time of year predicted ice cream sales, but there actually is no causal relationship.</p>
<div id="confounding-relationships" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">28.5.1</span> Confounding relationships</h3>
<p>So, what other relationships can exist other than a direct causal relationship? There could be a <strong>spurious</strong> relationship between the two variables (let’s call them X and Y), where some third variable (let’s call it Z) is actually the causal factor.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Z \rightarrow X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z \rightarrow Y\)</span></p>
<p>Spurious relationships are especially problematic, because they will result in an association between two variables that is not causal.</p>
<p>There could be a <strong>chain relationship</strong>, where:</p>
<p>X <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> Z and <span class="math inline">\(Z \rightarrow Y\)</span></p>
<p>There could be multiple <strong>causal relationships</strong>, where:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z \rightarrow Y\)</span></p>
<p>Finally, there could be <strong>reverse causality</strong>, where,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y \rightarrow X\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="example-women-in-tech-firms" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">28.5.2</span> Example: Women in tech firms</h3>
<p>When it is laid out like this, it can all seem very simple. Duh, right? <strong>Wrong</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, thinking carefully about causation can be very hard, and many people are very, very bad at it. Does more education lead to higher turnout, or are socioeconomically advantaged peoople more likely to grow up in a house that encourages both education and voting? Does paying Kaplan $10,000 for LSAT training cause people to have higher scores, or are high achievers just more likely to be willing to pay $10,000? Endogenity is everywhere, and we rarely stop to consider it.</p>
<p>And it matters. As an example, consider the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586-Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.html">10-page memo distributed internally at Google in the Summer of 2017</a>. The document is a bit dense, but the argument essentialy breaks down like this.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Psychology has said that women are different than men in terms of of traits like
<ul>
<li>empathizing vs. systemtizing</li>
<li>extraversion/agreeableness</li>
<li>neuroticism</li>
<li>status seeking</li>
<li>desire for work-life balance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since these differences can explain differential interest and success in computer science (and related fields), policies designed to achieve gender balance are “unfair, divisive, and bad for business.”</li>
</ol>
<p>At the time, this memo caused quite a stir and got a lot of media attention. After Google fired the author, some commentators were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/opinion/sundar-pichai-google-memo-diversity.html">appalled at Google’s reaction</a>. After all, a lot of high-quality scientific results backed up the claims that men differ from women. Why does Google hate science?</p>
<p>The answer is that Google understands <em>social</em> science. The author was making a causal claim, and in doing so he had failed to take into account the most important factor in causal analysis in the social sciences – confounders.</p>
<p>The claim is that gender differences in personality/ambition/whatever (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>) cause women to be less interested/successful in tech (<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>). <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Could it be a supurrious relationship? So let’s imagine a world in which there are gender norms (<span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>). That is, maybe women and men aren’t treated the same. Now, we could imagine that:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Z \rightarrow X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z \rightarrow Y\)</span></p>
<p>This means that gender norms could, for instance, lead women to desire grater work-life balance <strong>and</strong> that gender norms could work against professional success in the tech industry. If this was the case, it would <em>appear</em> as if things like gender differences in, for example, “desire for work-life balance” are correlated with success/interest in tech. But, in fact, this relationship would not be causal. The same argument goes for personality differences and everything else. No matter how much we try to ignore it, <strong>correlation is not causation</strong> in the social world because so many things are involved in determining outcomes.</p>
<p>To see this more clearly, let’s also note that women have longer hair and shorter fingers than men on average (there are, of course, men with long hair and women with short hair). Following the logic used in this memo we could argue:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Physiologically, women may have a harder time engaging in computer science because:
<ul>
<li>Short fingers (makes it hard to type)</li>
<li>Long hair (gets in the way of screen)</li>

<li>Since these differences <em>can</em> explain differential interest and success in computer science (and related fields), policies designed to achieve gender balance are “unfair, divisive, and bad for business.”</li>
</ol>
<p>And empirically this would be true. If I ran a study comparing the succss of people at Google based on hair length, I would find a negative correlation.</p>
<p>But this argument is on its face idiotic because there are <em>so many</em> other things that determine the success of programmers that might <em>happen</em> to also be correlated with finger size and hair length. Those other things are called <strong>confounders</strong>. And failing to consider them can lead you to a very wrong conclusion.</p>

<p>X causes Y if Y would not have occurred if not for X. Ideally, to establish causation, we use experiments, in which we manipulate X, and see if Y occurs. We use random assignment to ensure that the only difference between the treatment and control groups is the treatment.</p>
<p>If we cannot use experiments, then we have to rely on other methods to establish correlation. But because correlation does not imply causation, we need to establish temporal order, establish association, and rule out other explanations. This is much more difficult, and requires more advanced statistical techniques.</p>
