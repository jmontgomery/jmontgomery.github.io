What type of variables? Age and Vote Intentions Party Ideology and Party Desire to Form Coalitions Income groups and Spending on Alcohol 34.1 Discrete by Discrete Data Display Assume the two variables of interest are both countably discrete. To examine the relationship between these variables, we will use . A contingency table is used to plot membership by groups. Democrat Republican Male 36 56 Female 43 22 Here we see that women are more likely to be Democrats than men. 34.2 Contingency Tables The same contingency table with row percentages. Does it make more sense to percentagize by sex or vote in the previous table? General rule: percentagize by the independent/ explanatory variable. Below we do it by gender (i.e. by row). Democrat Republican Male 39.1% 60.9% Female 66.1% 33.9% Note that the percentages add up to 100 on each row, not over each column. 34.3 Creating Contingency Tables in R Recall: Contingency tables take factors. If it is not a factor, you will need to convert it (see the chapter on average treatment effects.) Code like this will give you a contingency table: # Frequency freq.tab &lt;- with(data, table(factor1, factor2)) Code like this will give you a contingency table with percentages: #Percentage with(data, round(prop.table(freq.tab)*100, 2)) Code like this will conduct the \\(\\chi^2\\) test for independence: # Chi-Square chisq.test(freq.tab) 34.4 Discrete by Continuous Displays When we have one discrete variable and one continuous Rely on some of the methods that we have used previously! Options: boxplots for each group; histograms for each group; plot the distribution of observations for each group. You can make plots like this using the boxplot() function: boxplot(y~x,data = dataset, xlab = &quot;Informative X label&quot;, ylab = &quot;Informative Y label&quot;, main = &quot;Informative Title&quot;,col = c(col1, col2, ....)) 34.5 Continuous By Continuous Displays If we want to examine the relationship between two continuous variables graphically, we will utilize a scatterplot. Income by Age Income by Ideology (21-point scale) Note: when ordered categories are plenty enough, consider them as continuous plot(x, y, data = dataset, main = &quot;Informative Title&quot;, xlab = &quot;Informative X label&quot;, ylab = &quot;Informative Y label&quot;, pch = 19) 34.6 The value of Scatterplots Scatterplots allow us to assess the direction and strength of a relationship between 2 variables. 3 types of relationships: Positive: As x increases, y also increases. Negative: As x increases, y decreases. No Relationship: There is no relationship between the variables. 34.6.1 In R, we can only make scatterplots with numeric variables! Check whether the variable is numeric using code like this: str(datasetname$variableofinterest) is.numeric(datasetname$variableofinterest) If your variable is not numeric in structure but convertible to be numeric, such as numbers as factor levels or numbers as characters within quotation marks, we can convert it to a numeric variable (only if it makes sense): datasetname$newvariable &lt;- as.numeric(datasetname$variableofinterest) "]
