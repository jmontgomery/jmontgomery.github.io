\section*{Instructions}

\benum
  \item The following questions should each be answered within an R script. Be sure to provide many comments in the script to facilitate grading. Undocumented code will not be graded. 
  \item For the real midterm you may NOT work in teams.  So you should practice that.  But once you are done you should compare results with eachother to better leran from your peers.
  \item This is open note, open book, open Internet test.  But each keystroke in the assignment should be your own. Do not copy and paste from each other or from the Internet or even from the notes.
  \item The test is designed to take approximately 5 hours.  But you can spend up to eight hours to do it.
  \item Part of your grade will be based on the readibility of your script.  I will be running all of your code.  If I don't understand what you are doing, I can't give partial credit.  So pay attention to tabs, comments, and other tricks we have talked about for organizing your code.
  \item As with all aspects of this class, there is not going to be a single "right" answer.  That is not how real data analysis works. But I will try and provide you a lot of guidance.  If you are confused, go ahead and ping me on slack.  I can't promise I'll answer right away, but I will when I can.

\section*{Introduction and orientation}

You are going to be using the following dataset:
http://ippsr.msu.edu/sites/default/files/correlatesofstatepolicyprojectv2_1.csv

This is data from the *correlates of state policy* database.  You can read more about that here: http://ippsr.msu.edu/public-policy/correlates-state-policy

> The Correlates of State Policy Project aims to compile, disseminate, and encourage the use of data relevant to U.S. state policy research, tracking policy differences across the 50 states and changes over time. We have gathered more than 900 variables from various sources and assembled them into one large, useful dataset. We hope this project will become a “one-stop shop” for academics, policy analysts, students, and researchers looking for variables germane to the study of state policies and politics.

Here is the complete codebook: https://ippsr.msu.edu/sites/default/files/CorrelatesCodebook.pdf
