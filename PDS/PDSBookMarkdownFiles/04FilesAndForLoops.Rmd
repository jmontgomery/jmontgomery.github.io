# Files and For Loops

## The working directory

First we want to change the working directory.  This is the folder where R will save and look for data by default (although you can always override this)

Note that the file path (in Windows at least) requires slashes. You can either use two back slashes to separate folders or one forward slash.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/Dropbox/Classes/R Programming")
## For Windows, will need to be something like
setwd("C:\\Documents and Settings\\Jacob Montgomery\\My Documents\\RWork")
## or
setwd("C:/Documents and Settings/Jacob Montgomery/My Documents/RWork")
## or
setwd(file.path("C:", "Documents and Settings", "Jacob Montgomery", "My Documents", "RWork"))
```

## Input and output

```{r, eval=FALSE}
voting.data<-data.frame(vap, tv)
```

Now let's save our newly created dataset
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dump("voting.data", "voting.data.R") # inputs are string.  Note that you must put the *.R in yourself
```

You might also want to save multiple objects
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dump(c("vap", "tv"), "voting.data.vectors.R")
dump(list=objects(), "everything.R")
## an alternative we can just use the command
save.image("everything.RData") # saves an image of your current workspace
```

Now we can clear our wokspace, and load these objects
```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
source("voting.data.vectors.R")
ls() # only saved objects present
```

To read/write dataframes from/to a csv (comma separated values) file, the following commands will be useful
```{r, eval=F}
votes.06<-read.csv("~/Dropbox/Classes/R Programming/R Scripts/VotingData2006.csv", header=T)
write.csv(votes.06, file="VD06.csv")
```
Tips: All of the functions for reading in data are actually using the scan() function. No matter how crazy your data look, you can *always* read it into R by clever use of scan().
