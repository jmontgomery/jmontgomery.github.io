# Getting Started in R

## Learning Objectives 

1. Learn how to assign a value to an object in R.

2. Learn your way around R (using R Studio).

3. Learn how to do simple arithmetic in R.

## Assigning values to objects

You can assign values to objects in two ways as shown below. The assignment arrow is functionally equivalent to the equal sign. When assigning values to objects, R will always take the value on the right side of the assignment operator (<- or =) and store it in the object on the left side of the assignment operator. This means that the two lines of commented code in the following snippet do different things. 

Side note: to comment a single line of code in R, use the hashtag or pound sign at the beginning of the line. If you're working in an R script, the commented portion will turn green.
```{r}
x <- 4
x

y = 6
y

#y = x
#x = y
```
