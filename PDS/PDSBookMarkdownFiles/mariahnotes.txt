//todo:

write an intro chapter?

provide more narration between lines of code (even only a sentence or two)
don't put things in comments

package development (one of my projects)

//done:

projects in RStudio (another project maybe?)

you can index/subset a matrix with a vector of logicals/booleans just like you can index an array
matrices and vectors can only contain one data type (but not dataframes!)

dataframes always have column names

get the matrix algebra notes
https://www.statmethods.net/advstats/matrix.html

add array notes

reading and writing files (Lecture3.R)

lecture on control structure (if, while, for, repeat)

lecture 7 write up book chapter on version control

screen snips for git/github/version control with circles around 
need to be able to set up a repository, clone, commit/push, sync/pull, fork, how to deal with conflicts
