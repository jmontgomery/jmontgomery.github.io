**With your group, figure out how to do the following**


1. Run this code and change the sign of every odd number in x
```{r, eval=FALSE}
 x <- sample(-100:100, size = 100)
```

2. Subset 'x' so that it contains only numbers between 20 and 93

3. Make a new variable called 'catX' that is has values '0', '1', and '2' based on whether 'x' is in the following ranges: 0=(-100, -30); 1=(-31, 3), 2=(4-100)

4. Make a new variable that is subset of 'x' based on whether 'catX' is 1 OR 2

5.  Make a new variable that is subset of 'x' based on whether 'catX' is 1 OR 2 but also only odd numbers.
