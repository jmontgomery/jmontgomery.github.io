\subsubsection*{Write the R code to answer the following questions.}


1. Use the \texttt{seq()} and \texttt{paste()} to create the vector called \texttt{varnames} containing: \texttt{"Var1" "Var2" "Var3" "Var4" "Var5" "Var6"}
2. Remove the substring \texttt{``Var''} from the \texttt{varnames} vector
3. Recast the \texttt{varnames} vector into a numeric. Store that as a new object.
4. Make a vector that contains  numeric, character, and logical.  What is its class?
5. Read in the Gettysbur address using the code below.  Remove the string '???'.  How many words does it contain? (Don't worry if you get a warning)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gettysburg<-readLines("http://politicaldatascience.com/PDS/ClassActivities/
                      Activity3/Gettysburg",warn=F)
```
