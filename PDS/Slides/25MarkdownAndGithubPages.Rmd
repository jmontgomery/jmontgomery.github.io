This Time

1. Using Markdown create web content

2. Applying your knowledge of Markdown to make yourself a simple website

--

Next time

1. Interactive visualizations
    - Use R code to make dynamic web applications that users can interact with


---

## Introduction for today

- What is Markdown
  - Markdown is a powerful yet relatively simple to that allows users to create web content
  
  - The language relies on a set of rules which allows you to manage headers, font, and lists with ease
  
  - Slack, Reddit and Skype all apply Markdown style rules which make formatting messages easy

--

- Why should I use it?

  - It is an easy-to-read and easy-to-write (and easy-to-learn) plain text format

  - It is simple to convert to HTML without needing a broad knowledge of HTML features which allows you to make a web page without programming skills

  - Variants such as R Markdown allow you to make complex documents (PDF's, word documents, Shiny apps) with ease

---

## Syntax

- There are a few features of Markdown which can cover your basic needs when presenting text in a variety of formats

  - Text emphasis
  
  - Headers
  
  - Lists
  
  - Paragraphs
  
  - Hyperlinks
  
  - Images

## Text Emphasis

### *Italics*
  - **Code**: `You can make a *phrase* _italicized_ two ways: by wrapping it in a single set of * (astericks) or _ (underscores)`

--

  - **Output**: You can make a *phrase* _italicized_ two ways: by wrapping it in a single set of *(astericks) or _ (underscores)

--

### **Bold text**
  - **Code**: `Similarly there are a couple of ways to make a **phrase** __bold__: by using two sets of ** (asterics) or __ (underscores)`

--

  - **Output**: Similarly there are a couple of ways to make a **phrase** __bold__: by using two sets of ** (asterics) or __ (underscores)
  
---
## Headers

### **Code**

  - `# First level`
  
  - `## Second level`
  
  - `### Third level`
  
--

### **Output**

  - # First level 

  - ## Second level

  - ### Third level


---

##  Numbered lists

### **Code**

  - `1. List item 1`
  
  - `2. List item 2`
  
  - `3. List item 4`
  
--

### **Output**

   1. List item 1
  
   2. List item 2
  
   3. List item 3

---

## Numbered lists with subpoints

### **Code**

   `1. List item 1 (return twice for blank line)`
   
     `(single tab) - Subpoint 1`
     
   `2. List item 2 (return twice for blank line)`
    
     `(single tab) - Subpoint 2`
     
   `3. List item 3 (return twice for blank line)`
   
     `(single tab) - Subpoint 3`
  
---

## Numbered lists with subpoints

### **Output**

   1. List item 1
   
    -Subpoint 1
    
   2. List item 2
   
    -Subpoint 2
    
   3. List item 3
   
    -Subpoint 3

---

## Plain list

### Code

  `- (Space)List item 1(return twice for blank line)`
  
    `(single tab)- Subpoint 1 (return twice for blank line)`
    
      `(another tab)- Subsubpoint 1(return twice for blank line)`
  
  `- (Space)List item 2 (return twice for blank line)`
  
    `(single tab)- Subpoint 2 (return twice for blank line)`
    
      `(another tab)- Subsubpoint 2 (return twice for blank line)`

---

## Plain list
###Output

  - List item 1
  
    - Subpoint 1
      
      - Subsubpoint 1
      
  - List item 2
  
    - Subpoint 2
      
      - Subsupoint 2
      
          - After 3 subpoints, you can start doing **double tabs**
        
             - if you have a ridiculously long number of sublists
          
                  - See?
                  
                  
---

## Lists can be picky

### **Code**
     `-This is what happens` 
       `-without a space after the dash or a blank line`
      
     `- And this is what happens`
    
    
        `- if you add an extra blank line`
      
### **Output**

  -This is what happens
    -without a space after the dash or a blank line
  
  - And this is what happens
  
  
    - If you add an extra blank line
  
---

## Paragraphs

Writing a paragraph is simple, you start anywhere and you just write the text which you want to read. 

Once you are ready for a new paragraph all you have to do is leave a blank line between the last sentence of the previous paragraph and the first sentence of the new paragraph. Don't expect there to be the normal indents on each paragraph thought!

See?

## Hyperlinks and Images
    
  - Images and hyperlinks are both similar and easy. 
  - The only difference is, in images, you must put an exclamation point before the brackets.
  
### Code
