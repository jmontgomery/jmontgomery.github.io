## Orientation for today
Last time

  1. Practiced using API's to access data from online sources

  
--

This Time

1. Using Markdown create web content

2. Applying your knowledge of Markdown to make yourself a simple website

--

Next time

1. Interactive visualizations
    - Use R code to make dynamic web applications that users can interact with


---

## Introduction for today

1. What is Markdown
  - Markdown is a powerful yet relatively simple tool that allows users to create web content
  
  - The language relies on a set of rules which allows you to manage headers, font, and lists with ease
  
  - Slack, Reddit and Skype all apply Markdown style rules which make formatting messages easy

--

2. Why should I use it?

  - It is an easy-to-read and easy-to-write (and easy-to-learn) plain text format

  - It is simple to convert to HTML without needing a broad knowledge of HTML features which allows you to make a web page without programming skills

  - Variants such as R Markdown allow you to make complex documents (PDF's, word documents, Shiny apps) with ease

---

## Syntax
  + There are a few features of Markdown which can cover your basic needs when presenting text in a variety of formats
  
  + These include:
  
    - Headers
    
    - Paragraphs

    - Text emphasis
    
    - Lists
    
    - Hyperlinks
    
    - Images

## Headers

### **Code**

  - `# First level`
  
  - `## Second level`
  
  - `### Third level`
  
--

### **Output**

  - # First level 

  - ## Second level

  - ### Third level
  
---

## Paragraphs

Writing a paragraph is simple, you start anywhere and you just write the text which you want to read. 

Once you are ready for a new paragraph all you have to do is leave a blank line between the last sentence of the previous paragraph and the first sentence of the new paragraph. Don't expect there to be the normal indents on each paragraph thought!

See?

## ***Text Emphasis***

### *Italics*
  - **Code**: `You can make a *phrase* _italicized_ two ways: by wrapping it in a single set of * (astericks) or _ (underscores)`

--

  - **Output**: You can make a *phrase* _italicized_ two ways: by wrapping it in a single set of *(astericks) or _ (underscores)

--

### **Bold text**
  - **Code**: `Similarly there are a couple of ways to make a **phrase** __bold__: by using two sets of ** (asterics) or __ (underscores)`

--

  - **Output**: Similarly there are a couple of ways to make a **phrase** __bold__: by using two sets of ** (asterics) or __ (underscores)

      - Subpoint 3

---

## Plain list

### Code

  `- (Space)List item 1`
  
    `(single tab)- Subpoint 1 `
    
      `(double tab)- Subsubpoint 1`
  
  `-  (Space)List item 2`
  
    `(single tab)- Subpoint 2`
    
      `(double tab)- Subsubpoint 2`
  
  `-  (Space)List item 3`
  
    `(single tab)- Subpoint 3`
    
      `(double tab)- Subsubpoint 3`
---

## Plain list

  - List item 1
  
    - Subpoint 1
      
      - Subsubpoint 1
      
  - List item 2
  
    - Subpoint 2
      
      - Subsupoint 2
      
  - List item 3
  
    - Subpoint 3
    
      - Subsubpoint 3
                  
                  
---

## Don't forget your spaces

### **Code**
     `-This is what happens` 
       `-without a space after the dash`

      
### **Output**

  -This is what happens
    -If you don't include a space after the dash

  
---
## Activity 1

- Open an R Markdown file in RStudio

- Give the file the title 'Activity 1' and put your name as the author

- Delete all of the stock information the R Markdown file gives you:

    - `## R Markdown
          This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see
      ` etc...


- Write a paragraph about what have been the most useful aspects of this class for you and include the following skills:
    - Headers
    - Text emphasis
    - Lists
    - Paragraphs

- Now **save** this .rmd file and name it _index_

---
## Hyperlinks and Images
    
  - Images and hyperlinks are both similar and easy. The only difference is, in images, you must put an exclamation point before the brackets.
  
### Code

  - `[The website for class](politicaldatascience.com)`
  - `![A computer with data](http://politicaldatascience.com/PDS/Datasets/photo1.jpg)`
  
---

## Hyperlinks and Images

### Output

  - [The website for class](http://politicaldatascience.com/)
  
  
   ![A computer with data](http://politicaldatascience.com/PDS/Slides/Images/photo1.jpg)
---

## Code chunk

![](./Images/add_code.png)

- Knit!
---

## Activity 2
- Now in the index file which you started in activity 1, include the following three aspects:
   - Hyperlinks 
      - Link to our class: politicaldatascience.com
      
    - Images 
      - Use the following image: http://politicaldatascience.com/PDS/Slides/Images/image2.jpg
      
    - Code chunks
      - Load in the `fivethirtyeight` package into your chunk
    
      - Include the following code in your document and have it display **the code and its output**:
         - trump_twitter$text[1:5]
        
- Hit the knit button and upload the html file to the Slack channel for today's class

# Github Pages

- Now that we know the basics of Markdown and how to use them in R Markdown, we have the skills we need to create a website

- Follow along with the directions of the following slides and these will serve as your final activity

---

## Create a repository

- The first thing you will need to do is make a repository for your website

--

- On your Github home page click `Repositories` tab then click the green `New` button

<center> <img src="./Images/new_repo.png" width="400"></center>

--
- Create a repository with the following name

  - *username*.github.io
  
     - Where _username_ is put in your username for Github. Mine is domlockett, Jacob's is jmontgomery.
     
    - If the username is not identical to your actual Github username this will not work
    
--

- *Note:* You only get one free webpage from Github. If you already have one let us know via the Slack channel for today's class
---
![](./Images/create_io_repo.png)
---
## Clone your repository

- Now clone the repository so that you have it saved to your Github Desktop

- Open the file folder for your *username*.github.io repository

--

## The index file

--

- Copy the .rmd file that you created in **activity 1 and 2** and paste it into your new repository

  - If you did not save the name of this file as index(.rmd) in the first activity, be sure to do so now

--

- Open your index file and knit it once more so that the html output saves in your new *username*.github.io directory

--

- Now push the changes

---

## Publish your page

- Go to your repository on github.com and go to the settings option

![](./Images/settings.png)
---

## Publish the page

- Scroll down to the section named `Github Pages`

<center> <img src="./Images/publish_repository.png" width="350"></center>

- Change the source from none to `master branch`

- You should see a green bar that confirms your site is published

<center> <img src="./Images/published.png" width="400"></center>

  - [Click it!](https://dlockett91.github.io)
  

---

## You have now created a webpage

- Sit back and admire your handiwork

- There are lots of ways that you can customize Markdown code to accomidate the needs of your website, PDF, or word document
  
  - Insert html code directly for tables, use LaTeX code, etc
  
    - You will have to surf Stack Overflow to fulfill your basic needs
    
---

## Activity 3

- If you have followed along you should be done with activity 3

  - Paste your *username*.github.io url into the Slack channel for today's class
  
- If you did not follow along, go back and do the steps outlined in the Github Pages portion of this lecture
