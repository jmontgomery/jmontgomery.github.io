# The New Normal
### <p>Jacob M. Montgomery<br />
<em>Washington University in St.Â Louis</em><br />
<em>Department of Politcal Science</em></p>
### 2020

---



## Orientation for today

1. Getting to know Zoom.

2. Updated syllabus.  

3. The state of the world/discussion

---

## This is the new normal, but it's not normal

Here are some things I am feeling.

1. Confused
2. Scared
3. Frustrated/Angry
4. Anxious
5. Sad

You might feel this way too.  And you are allowed to.  



---

## Zoom 

Let's try out some features

1. Alt-Y will raise your hand
2. Hold down the spacebar to unmute
3. Reactions at the bottom of the screen
4. Chat
5. White board.
6. Screen sharing.
7. Breakouts

--

NOTE: You are not permitted to share these recordings, and doing so will be concisered an academic integrity violation.




---

## Some business

- You all have your midterm grades now.
- My understanding is that the College will allow you to switch to Pass/Fail and back until the end of the semester.
- The updated syllabus is now on the website.
- IMPORTANT: All class communications will continue to take place through Slack and things will still be in flux as we all figure things out.


---

## New syllabus: Key takeaways

- Office hours are now on slack or Zoom.
- You also can add yourself to my schedule using the appoint.ly link.  But caveats.
- You are not required to come to class, but you are required to watch the recording and participate in ongoing group work. (Remember: I know how to use GitHub too.)
- Recordings of class sessions will be posted on Slack (I hope).

---

- I removed several topics from the syllabus.
- I understand some of you don't have textbooks.
- Only one more problem set.  And remember you can drop your lowest grade.
- Main thing going forward is your group project.

---

## Other policies

- There is a reason online learning has not caught on, and that reason is (partly) you.
- Zoom warnings.
- Group work/between class assignments
- Lectures/recordings
- TA stuff

## Novel coronovirus

- The virus is known as Covid-19, and is related to more common covid viruses (e.g., the common cold) as well as the SARS virus. 
- It is different from more common diseases (e.g., influenza) in two critical ways:
    * It is new, so human populations have no immunity.  This means it is highly contageous.
    * It is far deadlier.
- The disease was first detected in Wuhan, China around November 2019.
- WHO declared it a global pandemic on March 11.
- It has now spread to nearly every country on earth.


---

## Where we are

As of yesterday, globally: 
- 166 countires have confirmed cases.
- Over 383,000 *confirmed* casses.  (Actual cases likely much higher.)
- Over 16,500 have died.
- The epicenter is in Europe, but is spreading in the US and spreading to all parts of the world.
- The developing world is likely to be heavily impacted.

--

In the U.S. 
- Over 42,600 *confirmed* cases in the US, although widespread testing is just starting.
- Over 540 deaths.

---

## Spread by country

---

## Reported cases in the US

---

## Exponential growth

- Initial phases of this pandemic are showing evidence of exponential growth.  
- Roughly speaking, the number of confirmed casses is doubling every 3-ish days.


![map](./Images/growthUS.jpeg)

--

- If this continues (and it probably won't), we would expect to have over on million cases sometime in April.


---

## Why does it spread so fast?

- It is novel.
- Many (most?) with the disease do not even know they have it.  Mild symptoms.  
- In China, 86% of those infected did not know they had it. 
- Long period of asymptomatic infection

---

## Government/society response is key here

---

## Why is this different than the flu?

- For many this will be just the cold.  But many others will much worse.

- Note that "not severe" symptoms can include pneumonia. 

- *Lower* range CDC estiamtes for 65-75 year olds US are:
    + 31% require hospitalizations 
    + 11% require ICU care (many put under and onto vents)
    + 2.7% fatality
    
--
    
- *Lower* range CDC estiamtes for 20-44 year olds US are:
  + 14% require hospitalization
  + 2% require ICU care
  + 0.1% fatality
    

--

- Actual rates will likely be lower because so few are tested now, but it is not the flu


---

---

## How deadly is it?

- The answer here is that "it depends"
    + The healthcare that the average patient receives
    + Underlying health conditions in the population
    + Whether the medical system can keep up with infection rate.

---

## Flatten the curve

- There is no known treatment and no vaccine.
- Containment appears to be impossible.  
- But we can drastically reduce the overall fatality rate by:
    - Slowing the spread so we aren't all sick at the same time.
    - Increasing the capacity of the health system.


--

- This is why WashU closed.
- This is why you should isolate, wash hands, and reduce the spread.



---

## Here is the goal for now

## Economic consequences

## Where are we going?

- Moving onto boggy ground.
- I will give you my own opinion here, but the real answer is that no one knows.  
- Please do not share these slides on social media.  There are enough armchair epidemiologists out there without adding my take.

---

## Where we go from here depends on assumptions.  Here are mine.

- Covid-19 is here to stay
- Even if eliminated, cannot permanently isolate countries and will return.
- The policy goal seems to be to reduce transmission rates until science finds a better answer.

---
## Possible versions of the future

- Option 1: Uncontrolled spread, high death toll, collatoral damage to the well.



- Option 2: "Social distancing" to reduce and then strangle the spread.  
    * This is what was done in Wuhan, but involved extreme policies that may be difficult to execute in western democracies.
	* And not clear US can execute in any case.
  * Not clear what happens when it returns.
    


- Option 3: Test and trace.
    * S. Korea and Taiwan have done this with great success so far.
    * The US is nowhwere near ready to execute this at scale.  But moving in that direction.
    
--

- My take is that we should expect a long period (at least 3 months) of continued spread and isolation.  Followed by some form of relaxed restrictions coupled with widespread testing.  




---

## On the economic side ...


- Here I am on slightly firmer ground, but there is still a huge amount of uncertainty
- We are now at the start of the greatest global recession the world has experienced in postwar history.
- But if the health issues can be resolved, there is a chance to begin growth at the same remarkable pace.
- The amount of uncertainty going forward is very large.

## So what should you do?

Try and keep two things in mind at the same time: 
- (1) This situation is serious and requires a serious policy response.  
- (2) This is not the Walking Dead or anythin close to it.  


1. Stay physically isolated to help reduce/eliminate transmission.
2. Wash your hands.
3. Stay socially connected with your support network.
4. Use the resources provided by us.



---

## Parting thoughts

- The best responses are going to be data-driven.
- But data without understanding are dangerous.  Must be combined with significant area knowledge and experience.
- Accurate prediction here is nearly impossible in all domains.
