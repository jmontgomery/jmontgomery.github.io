## Classification: A special type of function


- Last time we talked about thinking about machine learning as finding a function that maps from features to outcomes

`$$y \sim f(X)$$`
- The *regression* model we used last time was for:
    * A continous outcome
    * An outcome where `\(y\)` can take on any value between `\(\infty\)` and `\(-\infty\)`.
    
--

- But in many cases `\(y\)` is constrained
    - For vote share, we might want to constrain to be between 0 and 1? (A proportion)
    - For categorical outcomes, we might want to constrain `\(y\)` to be just 0 or 1. (Binary)
  
  
--

- People often call cases where we are trying to put `\(y\)` into discrte bins a *classifier*.

---
## Classification basics: Binary outcomes

- The difference between regression and classification is that we look at a special type of function, `\(f(X)\)`.

--

- We want a function that will:
    - Take in a set of features `\(X\)` that can take on all kinds of values (binary, continuous, etc.)
    - But it will "squash" all of these features so that `\(f(X) \in [0, 1]\)`.  
    - We then say that the probability that `\(y=1\)` is equal to `\(f(x)\)`, or 
    `$$Pr(y=1) = f(x)$$`
- Intuitively, we are imagining the DGP as a weighted coin flip where the pobability of a "success" is determined by `\(f(x)\)`.

---
## Motivating example: Turnout in the 2008 election

- Imagine we are trying to build a model to predict turnout (0 or 1)
- We have the following featurs:
    * State
    * Ethnicity (White/Black/Hispanic/Other)
    * Age (Divided into quartiles)
    * Income (Divided into quartiles)


```r
turnout&lt;-read.csv("http://politicaldatascience.com/PDS/Datasets/SimpleTurnout2008.csv")
dim(turnout)
```

```
## [1] 73033     6
```


---
## The linear classifier (AKA Logit)

- Logit is a member of a family of models called a "generalized linear model"
- These models have two basic parts:
    - A *linear* component
    - A *squashing* component

---
## The linear part

We might for instance, set up an equation of:

`$$\Lambda=\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Income}+ \beta_2 \text{Age}$$`

- This is the same basic idea as normal regression models.
- But this linear combination can take on any value between `\(-\infty\)` and `\(\infty\)` (depending on what the `\(\beta\)` values are)

--

&gt; Example: What's `\(\Lambda\)` here?

- `\(\beta_0 = 16\)`
- `\(\beta_1=2\)`
- `\(\beta_2 = 1.5\)`
- Income = 2
- Age = 2

`$$23 = 16 + 2\times 2 + 1.5\times2$$`



---
## The squashing part

- But we can't use numbers like 23 to talk about turnout directly.  

- And there is nothing keeping this from evaluating to -200 or 3,272

- So the strategy will be to push `\(\Lambda\)` through a squasher

--

- These are often shaped like an "s", and are sometimes called a *sigmoid*.

- I am going to notate this as `\(\sigma(\cdot)\)`

`$$f(X) = \sigma(\Lambda)$$`

---
## The logistic squasher

- A very common choice for `\(\sigma(\cdot)\)` is the logistic function:

`$$\sigma(\Lambda) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-\Lambda)} = \frac{\exp(\lambda)}{1+\exp(\lambda)}$$`


```r
myLogistic&lt;-function(Lambda){
  return(1/(1+exp(-1*Lambda)))
}
testValues&lt;-seq(-8, 8, by=.1)
plot(testValues, myLogistic(testValues), type="l", ylab="Pred. Prob.")
```

![](19Classification_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
## So let's take a minute

- Use the function on the last slide and assume that:

$$\Lambda = -2 + (1 \times \text{Income}) + (0.7\times \text{Age})  $$

- What is `\(\Lambda\)` when Income=2 and Age=4?
- Put that through our squasher and tell me what the predicted probability will be.
- Do both calculations again but now assume Income=4 and Age=4

--

- So do the linear part first to get `\(\Lambda\)`.
- Then use the function I gave you on slide 9 to calculate the predicted probability.


---
## End Part A



---
## The linear classifier in theory

- Remember what we are trying to do: find some function `\(f(X)\)`.
- We have a linear portion like `\(\beta_1 \text{Income}+ \beta_2 \text{Age}\)`
- We put it through a squasher like the logistic function on Slide 9.
- When we combine this we get:

$$Pr(y=1) = \frac{\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Income}+ \beta_2 \text{Age})}{1+\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Income}+ \beta_2 \text{Age})} $$
--

- But how do we figure out the `\(\beta\)` coefficients?

---
##The linear classifier in practice

- For this class we'll use something maximum likelihood estimation, that is way outside the scope of this class.
- Basically, the computer will find the values of `\(\beta\)` that minimize a specific form of loss
- All you really need to know is how to do it.
    * We use the `glm` function.
    * We specify tht the data is binary by using the `family="binomial"` argument.

---


```r
Model1&lt;-glm(turnout ~ inc + age, family="binomial", data=turnout)
summary(Model1)
```

```
##

## glm(formula = turnout ~ inc + age, family = "binomial", data = turnout)

```

---

## A couple of takeaways

- The Coefficients reported here are from the linear part of the model.
    * You want to focus on the sign of the coefficients
    * And again you can get standard errors and p-values 
- The AIC number is a fit statistic, and we want it to be small (but hard to interpret)
- We can use the same `predict` approach we used before.
    * If we don't specify new data, it generates "in sample" predictions.
    * You want to use the option `type` to make sure you get the predicted probability part back and not the linear part.


```r
Model1preds&lt;-predict(Model1, type="response")
```

---

Let's look at the predictd probabilities for each value of Age in the dataset.


```r
boxplot(Model1preds~turnout$inc, xlab="Income", ylab="Predicted Probabilities")
```

![](19Classification_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
## Now it's your turn

- Fit your own linear classifier to this data using the data I've provided.
- You might try some new variables or even recoding a covariate if you want.
- Look at the output and make sure you understand what the coefficients are telling you (more or less).

---
## End Part B


---
## Fit statistics

- When we talked about regression, I emphasized the importance of out-of-sample testing to keep from "overfitting the data."
    - Complex models might seem to fit the data well, but do poorly out of sample.
    - Ths reflects a model that is confusing the "systematic" part of the data with the "error" part of the data.
- I introduced RMSE as a metric.  But what should we use for binary cases?

---

- There are a lot of choices here, and this is again a large topic I will only touch on.
- The easiest place to start is a "confusion matrix"

`$$\begin{array}{lcc}
&amp; \text{Truth=0} &amp; \text{Truth=1}\\
\text{Prediction = 0} &amp; \text{True negatives} &amp; \text{False negatives}\\
\text{Prediction = 1} &amp; \text{False negatives} &amp; \text{True Positives}\\
\end{array}$$`

--

- The diagnonal of this matrix are your correct predictions.
- Should you weight positives or negatives more?
    - Depends on the context
    - You will want to ballance or weight.
    
---

- One appproach is to look at precision and recall
    - **Precision** `$$\frac{\text{True positives}}{\text{True positives + Fase posiives}}$$`
    - **Recall** `$$\frac{\text{True positives}}{\text{True positives + Fase negatives}}$$`

- You can also recombine these in a bunch of ways to get things like false discoery rate, specificity, sensitivity, F1 scores, and more.

---
## Brier scores

- Another one is called the Brier Score, which is just RMSE.  Let `\(p_i\)` be our predicted probabilty for unit `\(i\)`.

`$$\sqrt{\frac{\sum_i^n{(y_i-p_i)^2}}{n}}$$`

---
## Going back to turnout



```r
binaryPred&lt;-(Model1preds&gt;0.5)*1
table(binaryPred, turnout$turnout)
```

```
##           
## binaryPred     0     1
##          0  4283  3809
##          1 18523 46418
```

- This is the confusion matrix where columns are the "truth" and rows are the predictions
- On your own, calculate the precision, recall, and accuracy (the percent of observations this model gets right)
- Put what you got into the slack channel for this lecture.  Make sure you know how to get the same answer as the rest of the class.


---
## End of Part C



---
## More models

- Of course, logistic regression is only one way to build `\(f(X)\)`. There are many more.
- Today I'll introduce two pretty easy ones:
    - Tree models
    - K-nearest neighbors
--

- Others you might look into include support vector machines, naive Bayes classifiers, neural networks, Gaussian process regression, and much, much, more.

---
## Tree models

## A final tree model


![  ](./Images/Turnout6.pdf) ![  ](./Images/Trees5.jpeg) 


---

## Let's try our own tree


```r
library(rpart)
equation&lt;-as.formula("turnout~eth+inc+age")
tree_mod1&lt;-rpart(equation, data=turnout)
```


---

```r
tree_mod1
```

```
## n= 73033 
## 
## node), split, n, deviance, yval
##       * denotes terminal node
## 
## 1) root 73033 15684.380 0.6877302  
##   2) inc&lt; 2.5 26982  6555.365 0.5839449  
##     4) age&lt; 2.5 11531  2881.491 0.4895499 *
##     5) age&gt;=2.5 15451  3494.450 0.6543913 *
##   3) inc&gt;=2.5 46051  8668.089 0.7485397  
##     6) age&lt; 1.5 8495  2044.887 0.5963508 *
##     7) age&gt;=1.5 37556  6381.940 0.7829641 *
```

- This tells us how the tree is constructed
- Better to look at it visually

---


```r
plot(tree_mod1)
text(tree_mod1, use.n=TRUE, all = TRUE, cex=0.8)
```

![](19Classification_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


---
## Tuning parameters

- Many ML models have *tuning parameters*, sometimes called *hyperparamaters* or *hyperpriors*.
- These are parameters that control how the function, but which typically are not estimated from the data.
- These are set by the analyst, often using some sort of cross-validation.
- Most often, these parameters control how *complex* each model is going to be.
- In the case of the `rpart` function these include:
    

---



```r
tree_mod2&lt;-rpart(equation, data=turnout, control=rpart.control(cp=.0002))
plot(tree_mod2)
text(tree_mod1, use.n=TRUE, all = TRUE, cex=0.7)
```

![](19Classification_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
## Complex or simple


```r
treePreds1&lt;-predict(tree_mod1); treePreds2&lt;-predict(tree_mod2)
```

- Compare the accuracy of these two models using a confusion matrix.
- Do the same use the Brier score

---
## End of Part D


---
## Random forests

- These models actually do not end up performing that well.
- Especially when the relationship between variables is smooth and not discontinuous.
- And they can be very sensitive to seemingly small changes to the data.


---



![  ](./Images/Sample1.pdf) ![  ](./Images/Sample2.pdf) 

![  ](./Images/Sample4.pdf) ![  ](./Images/Sample3.pdf) 

![  ](./Images/Sample5.pdf) 



---

## Intuition for random forests

- One idea is to take advantage of this sensitivity by *bootstrapping* the sample to create many trees and average their predictions for each unit.
- Does better with smooth, additive functions, and on the whole less sensitive to small changes in the data.
- The model will:
    * Randomly selecting rows of the data with replacement.
    * Randomly selecting `mtry` variables from the dataset
    * Build a tree
    * Do this `ntree` times and average the results


---
## Implementation for random forests


```r
library(randomForest)
turnout$turnout&lt;-as.factor(turnout$turnout) # Leave as continuous for regression
mod1_forest&lt;-randomForest(equation, data=turnout, 
                          ntree=201, mtry=2)
mod1_forest
```

```
## 
## Call:
##  randomForest(formula = equation, data = turnout, ntree = 201,      mtry = 2) 
##                Type of random forest: classification
##                      Number of trees: 201
## No. of variables tried at each split: 2
## 
##         OOB estimate of  error rate: 30.16%
## Confusion matrix:
##      0     1 class.error
## 0 4001 18805  0.82456371
## 1 3222 47005  0.06414876
```


---


## Your turn

- Make your own Random Forest model and mess with options:
    * `mtry`
    * `ntree`
    * `maxnodes`
- Put in your confusion matrix into the Slack channel for this class


---
## End Part E


---
## K Nearest Neighbors

- Another simple approach is just to look at observations that are "near" eachother.
- "Near" here just means that they have a similar in terms of their predictor variables.
