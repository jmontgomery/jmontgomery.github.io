## Orientation for today

Last time


1. Orientation for machine learning

--

This time

1. Very fast introduction to inference

--

Next time

1. Supervised learning


---


## Introduction to inference

- We are usually interested in making some statement about a population.

- But we only have a subset of the cases?  What to do?

--

- The answer most often used is some variation of this:
    + Gather the sample.
    + Make some assumptions appropriate to how the sample was collected.
    + Use logic and probability theory to then make an inference about the population.


---

## How is this typically done?


1. Imagine that we have taken a random sample from a population.

2. We calculate some statistic from this sample like the mean.  
    + This is our estimate.
    + But how accurate is it?

---

3. Statisticians often use
    + Knowledge about what that statistics will look like *if* we had followed this procedure again, and again, and again.
    + Simulating as if we had followed this same procedure agian, and again, and again.

## Get set up

Today we are going to use the 2019 data release from the Voter Study Group

- Download: https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/2019-voter-survey-full-data-set
- Codebook: https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/2019-voter-survey-full-data-set



```r
library(tidyverse)
VSG&lt;-read_csv("~/Downloads/VOTER_Survey_Jan217_Release1-csv.csv")
```

---

## Recode a bit


```r
with(VSG, table(fav_biden_2019))
```

```
## fav_biden_2019
##    1    2    3    4    8   98 
## 2230 1390  916 1815  344   84
```

```r
VSG&lt;-VSG %&gt;% 
  mutate(fav_biden_2019=na_if(fav_biden_2019, 8)) %&gt;%
  mutate(fav_biden_2019=na_if(fav_biden_2019, 98))
with(VSG, table(fav_biden_2019))
```

```
## fav_biden_2019
##    1    2    3    4 
## 2230 1390  916 1815
```

Here is the mean value:


```r
mean(VSG$fav_biden_2019, na.rm=TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 2.364667
```


---

## Now sample

- Now for our learning purposes, we are going to take a sample.



```r
set.seed(201)
sample_100= VSG %&gt;%
  sample_n(size=100)
```


- Can we use this to guess back to the mean value in the larger dataset?


```r
mean(sample_100$fav_biden_2019, na.rm=TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 2.234375
```


---

## Uhhhh ... that seems cool

- So that seems like a pretty good approach.

- Were we just lucky, or will this work more generally?

--

- (At least) two ways to think about that.
    + Probability theory
    + Resampling
    
    
---



## Sampling Distributions


&gt; A **sampling distribution** is the distribution of a **statistic** given repeated sampling.  



We use probability theory to derive a **distribution for a statistic**, which allows us (eventually) to make inferences about **populations**.  
  
  
---

### Central limit theorem

For random sampling with a **large** sample size `\(n\)`, the sampling distribution of the sample mean `\(\bar{y}\)` is approximately normal, where `\(\bar{y} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)\)`.





- `\(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\)` is called the standard error.

    - It is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.
    - Note that the formula includes the population standard deviation `\(\sigma\)`.
    - Pay attention or you will get them mixed up. 
- As `\(n \rightarrow \infty\)`, the standard error is going to get smaller and smaller.
- **This** is why the normal distribution is very important.   


---

## Class exercise

1. Find the standard deviation for `fav_biden_2019` using `sd`.
2. Calculate the `sd/sqrt(400)` 
3. Repeat what I did above 500 times, but save the mean you calculate.  Use a sample size of 400.
4. Calculate the standard deviation of these means.
5. Compare (4) to (2).


---

## So how does that actually work?

- So that's cool, but in real life we ony have *one* sample from the population to work with.

- One approach is to just use the formula above, but guess at things like `\(\mu\)` and `\(\sigma\)` based on our data.

--

- We want: `\(\bar{y} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)\)`

--

- We approximate this with:
`$$\bar{y} \sim N\left(\bar{y}, \frac{sd}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$$`


---

##Confidence Intervals for the Mean of Populations 

- Obtain `\(\bar{y}=\frac{\sum{y_i}}{n}\)`

- Obtain `\(\sigma_{\bar{y}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)` or `\(\hat{\sigma}_{\bar{y}}=\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}\)`

- Choose a confidence level
 
- Obtain confidence coefficient: `\(\frac{\text{confidence level}}{100}\)`

- Find the Z-score that corresponds to `\(\frac{(\text{1-confidence coefficient})}{2}\)` [Normal Table or R]


Confidence Interval for your chosen confidence level: 

`$$(\bar{y}-z*\sigma_{\bar{y}},\bar{y}+z*\sigma_{\bar{y}})$$`

---

## In R: 


- Get the mean, standard deviation and number of observations of thevariable you are interested in
- The &lt;code&gt;qnorm()&lt;/code&gt; gives you the required z-score.


```r
z.score = qnorm(1-confidence coefficient/2)
```

---

For example, for a 99\% confidence interval, I could use 

```r
z.score = qnorm((1-.01/2))
z.score
```

```
## [1] 2.575829
```


---

1) Get mean, sd, and n of the variable and save in appropriately named objects:


```r
mean.variable = mean(nameofdataset$nameofvariable,na.rm=T)
sd.variable = sd(nameofdataset$nameofvariable,na.rm=T)
n = length(na.omit(nameofdataset$nameofvariable))
```


2) Compute lower bound: 


```r
mean.variable - z.score*sd.variable/sqrt(n)
```

3) Compute upper bound:


```r
mean.variable+ z.score*sd.variable/sqrt(n)
```

---

## Class exercise

1. Take **one** sample of size 300 from our larger dataset.

2. Imagine that we only had this data.  Estimate a 95\% confidence interval for the population.

--

3. What do we mean by a 95\% confidence interval?

---

## Bootstrapping

A related idea goes like this:

1. Treat your sample as if it pretty much represents the population.
2. Re-sample your own data **WITH** replacement over and over again. You will want to use the `replace=TRUE` option for `sample_n` 
3. For each re-sample, calculate your statistic of interest.
4. The *standard deviation* of the resulting output is a good estimate of the standard error again. 
5. The quantiles can also be used, but you will want to do a lot more re-sampling (at least 500).

---

## Class activity

1. Make a function that will re-sample your sample (with replacement). Seems weird, but that's what we are doing.
2. Take 1,000 re-samples and calculate the mean of each.
3. Find the standard deviation of those **MEANS** and use that to calculate a 95% CI.
4. Use the quantile function to calculate the 95% CI for the mean and compare.
4. Calculate the standard deviation.  Use this as your estimate of the standard error and find a 95% confidence interval.
