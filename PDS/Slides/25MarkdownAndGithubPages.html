--

This Time

1. Using Markdown create web content

2. Applying your knowledge of Markdown to make yourself a simple website

--

    - Use R code to make dynamic web applications that users can interact with


---

# Introduction for today

1. What is Markdown
  - Markdown is a powerful yet relatively simple tool that allows users to create web content
  
  - The language relies on a set of rules which allows you to manage headers, font, and lists with ease
  
  - Slack, Reddit and Skype all apply Markdown style rules which make formatting messages easy

--

2. Why should I use it?

  - It is an easy-to-read and easy-to-write (and easy-to-learn) plain text format

  - It is simple to convert to HTML without needing a broad knowledge of HTML features which allows you to make a web page without programming skills

  - Variants such as R Markdown allow you to make complex documents (PDF's, word documents, Shiny apps) with ease

## Knit

- Knitting translates a document from Markdown code to the output of your choosing

- When you open this document from a file manager it will show the finished product

  - However, if you open this document with R Markdown you will see the complex HTML code used to compile the nice easy to read document you see at the front end

- When making a live website, knit and push using Github frequently to make sure all the changes are reflected in the HTML code
---
## Headers

### **Code**

  - `# First level`
  
  - `## Second level`
  
  - `### Third level`
  
--

### **Output**

  - # First level 

  - ## Second level

  - ### Third level
  
---

## Paragraphs

Writing a paragraph is simple, you start anywhere and you just write the text which you want to read. 

Once you are ready for a new paragraph all you have to do is leave a blank line between the last sentence of the previous paragraph and the first sentence of the new paragraph. Don't expect there to be the normal indents on each paragraph thought!

See?


---

## ***Text Emphasis***

### *Italics*
  - **Code**: `You can make a *phrase* _italicized_ two ways: by wrapping it in a single set of * (astericks) or _ (underscores)`

--

  - **Output**: You can make a *phrase* _italicized_ two ways: by wrapping it in a single set of *(astericks) or _ (underscores)

--

### **Bold text**

---
## Activity 1

- Open an R Markdown file in RStudio

- Give the file the title 'Activity 1' and put your name as the author

- Delete all of the stock information the R Markdown file gives you:

    - `## R Markdown
          This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see
      ` etc...


- Write a paragraph about what have been the most useful aspects of this class for you and include the following skills:
    - Headers
    - Text emphasis
    - Lists
    - Paragraphs

- Now **save** this .rmd file and name it _index_

    - **Code chunks**

## Equations

- Writing equations takes a set of knowledge by itself. Here are some common symbols:

  - `\(\sum\)`   `\(\Rightarrow\)` \sum
  
  - `\(\prod\)`   `\(\Rightarrow\)` \prod
  
  - `\(n^2\)`   `\(\Rightarrow\)` \n^2
  
  - `\(\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\)`    `\(\Rightarrow\)` \frac{n!}{K!(n-k)!}
  
  - `\(\int_{-\infty}^i\)`   `\(\Rightarrow\)` \int_{-\infty}^i
  
  - `\(\leftarrow\)`   `\(\Rightarrow\)` \leftarrow
  
  
- There are probably hundreds of unique symbols you might need to write equations. Here is a website that compiles some of the most commonly used symbols:

  - https://csrgxtu.github.io/2015/03/20/Writing-Mathematic-Fomulars-in-Markdown/

---
## Inline Equations

### Code
- To include an equation in-line such as `$E=MC^2$` you simply have to wrap the value in a single set of $ (dollar) signs.


### Output

To include an equation in-line such as `\(E=MC^2\)` you simply have to wrap the value in a single set of $ (dollar) signs.
---
## Standalone Equations

### Code

If you have a larger equation, you want to display outside of a paragraph use two sets of $ (dollar) signs.

`$$`x=-b \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2 -4ac}{2a}}`$$`

### Output

If you have a larger equation, you want to display outside of a paragraph use two sets of $ (dollar) signs.

`$$x=-b \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2 -4ac}{2a}}$$`
   
---
## Hyperlinks and Images
    
  - Images and hyperlinks are both similar and easy. The only difference is, in images, you must put an exclamation point before the brackets.
  
### Code

  - `[The website for class](politicaldatascience.com)`
  - `![A computer with data](http://politicaldatascience.com/PDS/Datasets/photo1.jpg)`
  
---

## Hyperlinks and Images

### Output

  - [The website for class](http://politicaldatascience.com/)
  
  
   ![A computer with data](http://politicaldatascience.com/PDS/Slides/Images/photo1.jpg)
---

## Code chunk

![](./Images/add_code.png)

- Knit!
---

## Activity 2
- Now in the index file which you started in activity 1, include the following three aspects:
   - Hyperlinks 
      - Link to our class: politicaldatascience.com
      
    - Images 
      - Use the following image: http://politicaldatascience.com/PDS/Slides/Images/image2.png
      
    - Code chunks
      - Load in the `fivethirtyeight` package into your chunk
    
      - Include the following code in your document and have it display **the code and its output**:
         - trump_twitter$text[7:10]
        
- Hit the knit button and upload the html file to the Slack channel for today's class

# Github Pages

- Now that we know the basics of Markdown and how to use them in R Markdown, we have the skills we need to create a website

- Follow along with the directions of the following slides and these will serve as your final activity

---

## Create a repository

- The first thing you will need to do is make a repository for your website

--

- On your Github home page click `Repositories` tab then click the green `New` button

&lt;center&gt; &lt;img src="./Images/new_repo.png" width="400"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

--
- Create a repository with the following name

  - *username*.github.io
  
     - Where _username_ is put in your username for Github. Mine is domlockett, Jacob's is jmontgomery.
     
    - If the username is not identical to your actual Github username this will not work
    
--

- *Note:* You only get one free webpage from Github. If you already have one let us know via the Slack channel for today's class
---
![](./Images/create_io_repo.png)
---
## Clone your repository

- Now clone the repository so that you have it saved to your Github Desktop

- Open the file folder for your *username*.github.io repository

--

## The index file

--

- Copy the .rmd file that you created in **activity 1 and 2** and paste it into your new repository

  - If you did not save the name of this file as index(.rmd) in the first activity, be sure to do so now

--

- Open your index file and add a line that says ***I know how to make a website!***

- Knit it once more so that the html output saves in your new *username*.github.io directory

---
## The index file
![](./Images/Directory.png)
--
- Now push the changes

---

## Publish your page

- Go to your repository on github.com and go to the settings option

![](./Images/settings.png)
---

## Publish the page

- Scroll down to the section named `Github Pages`

&lt;center&gt; &lt;img src="./Images/publish_repository.png" width="350"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

- Change the source from none to `master branch`

- You should see a green bar that confirms your site is published

&lt;center&gt; &lt;img src="./Images/published.png" width="400"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

  - [Click it!](https://dlockett91.github.io)
  

---

## You have now created a webpage

- Sit back and admire your handiwork

- There are lots of ways that you can customize Markdown code to accomidate the needs of your website, PDF, or word document
  
  - Insert html code directly for tables, use LaTeX code, etc
  
    - You will have to surf Stack Overflow to fulfill your basic needs
    
---

## Activity 3

- If you have followed along you should be done with activity 3

  - Paste your *username*.github.io url into the Slack channel for today's class
  
- If you did not follow along, go back and do the steps outlined in the Github Pages portion of this lecture
