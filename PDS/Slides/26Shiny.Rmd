## Orientation for this component

Last time

1. Getting data from the web (basics)
2. Getting data from the web (more tips)

--

Now


1. **Getting data from APIs**

--

Next

1. Making html documents/website (Dom)
2. R Shiny


--

But Really

**Work on your group projects**


---
## Getting started

- Application program interfaces (APIs) are a way for people (and programs) to access data in standard format 
- Allows others to build products/software around your data without full access to your data.
- Allows for sharing of data in a controlled way.
    - Only access at a given rate
    - Only access pre-specified fields
- Usually much more systematic and organized than webscraping
    - But also more powerful (can search their entire dataset)
    - Data comes back with expected structure
    - Documentation!!
- Huge enterprises like OpenSecrets, Twitter, Reddit, Wikipedia, and much more provide these.
- Could be used for making "live" webpages that re-render some kind of data viz. when a page is refreshed to represent changing data. 


---
## Remembering from last time


- We briefly discussed using `http` including commands

- `GET`, `POST`, and `PUT` will give you much of what you need.

- We also learned about the JSON object format, which is similar to a list in R.

--

- This time we are going to use the `httr` and `jsonlite` packages.

- The overall enterprise is to:
    1. Use `http` so pass the right arguments to the right API endpint.
    2. Get a JSON object back.
    3. Optionally use that result to structure a query to another endpoint.
    4. Repeat (3) until you have the data you want.

---
## Some API basics/terminology

- APIs have *endpoints* -- think of these as function that are available.
    - In the documentation (which you should read) it will explain what arguments these endpoints accept.
    - These are (sometiems) passed in via the `http` request.
    - They will then return to you a message (did it work) and an object 
    
----
    
- Most APIs have *rate limits* that control how much data they will return to you.  Try not to wine about people who are giving you free data.
- APIs typically *time out* if your request takes too long to execture, or else the endpint might have a workaround.
- Many will require that you have *authentication* often using a *key*
    - Note that some (e.g., Open Secrets and Twitter) require you to register or even apply

---
## Rough outline for today

- I'll run through a very simple toy example
- We'll do something slightly more complex with the google civic API.  
    - You'll need to register on your own to follow this example fully.
- I'll also show you an R package for making a specific API easier.    
- The only assignment we will have is I'd like each of you to identify *one* potentially interseting API for the class.  Bonus if you show the result of a query.

---
## Where is the space station?

- Here is a silly little API that tell us at any given time where the International Space Station is located.
- http://open-notify.org/
- If you go to the right url, you can see the answer:
http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json

---

- JSON object organized as key: value pairs

----

- "timestamp": 1587069040, 
- "message": "success"
-  "iss_position": 
    * "latitude": "-49.1436"
    * "longitude": "25.2204"

----

- Note that the last elment (iss_position) is itself composes of two elements.


---- 

So we are going to:
1. Send a "GET" request
2. Receive:
    
      a. A response code 
      
      b. Response data


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
library("httr"); library("jsonlite")
iss=GET("http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json")
length(iss)
```
---

- Not really the same as just navigating there.
- 200 is the "status response" and indicates success.
- Also includes a lot of details about the call (e.g., time and GET command)

--

- But the actual output we wanted is still there
- And we can pull this out as a "list of lists"

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
library("httr"); library("jsonlite")
fromJSON(rawToChar(iss$content))
```

---
## End part A

Go play!  See if you can figure out how many people are currently in space.

http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/

---

## APIs with arguments

- So this one is designed to tell you when the ISS is set to pass over a specific location

http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Pass-Times/

- But it requires parameters, just like arguments for a function.
- We need:
    - Latitude 
    - Longitude
- We could try to hack together the url ourselves    
    
http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json?lat=40.7&lon=-74

- But `GET` will do that for us

---


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
iss_pass=GET("http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json", 
             query=list(lat=38.6486009, lon=-90.3128798, n=1))
fromJSON(rawToChar(iss_pass$content))
```

- This is when the ISS will pass over Seigle Hall



---

## Ok that's fun, but kind of dumb

- Let's go look at the Google civic API

https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/v2/representatives/representativeInfoByAddress


- And look it has a handy GUI thing

---

### Well ... let's look some more

https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?pli=1


- You are going to need to get your authentication key
- And you you have to click a button in their system to confirm/authorize it.
- But you can borrow mine for now.
- Let's go back and look at this

https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/v2/representatives/representativeInfoByAddress



---



```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
myKey="AIzaSyDkCLZcCeC_Uc0d2ItcBBTUqJgk7Pl4ivQ"

SK<-GET("https://www.googleapis.com/civicinfo/v2/representatives",
         query=list(address="6186 McPherson Ave. St. Louis",
                    includeOffices="true",
                    levels="country",
                    roles="legislatorLowerBody", 
                    key="AIzaSyDkCLZcCeC_Uc0d2ItcBBTUqJgk7Pl4ivQ"))
SK
```



---


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
fromJSON(rawToChar(SK$content))
```

---


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
fromJSON(rawToChar(SK$content))$officials
```


---
### End Part B

- See if you can get this to work for a different address.
- If you want to go crazy try and get this endpoint to work instead

https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/v2/elections/voterInfoQuery


- use electionID="2000"


---
## API packages

- Smart people have made some R packages for specific APIs.
- So real quick I'll show you how to use the `ropensecretsapi`

---

## A first example


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
ropensecretsapi::SetAPIKey("4b774257ece93adea87064e2933ffbae")
params <- list (id="MO")
MoLegislators <- ropensecretsapi::GetLegislatorsData(params)
MoLegislators
```


---
## Just get the cid


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
MoLegislators$response$legislator[[1]]$`@attributes`[1]
```

---


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
MoLegislators$response$legislator[[1]]$`@attributes`[1]
```

---


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
IDsForMO<-rep(NA, length(MoLegislators$response$legislator))
for(i in 1:length(MoLegislators$response$legislator)){
  IDsForMO[i]<-MoLegislators$response$legislator[[i]]$`@attributes`[1]
}
```

---


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
IDsForMO
```

---


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
getTopDonors<-function(x){
    params<-list(cid=x, cycle="2018")
    ropensecretsapi::GetCandContribData(params)
}
getTopDonors(IDsForMO[1])
```

---


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7}
MoTopDonors2018<-plyr::llply(IDsForMO, getTopDonors)
str(MoTopDonors2018)
```


---

### Assignment


1. Find one API that might be of interest and post it on slack. 
2. Talk to your group about your group project
3. By the start of next class please have booked a meeting between me and most of your group.
